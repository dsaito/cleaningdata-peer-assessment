General Information
===================

The variables in the original data were obtained from the Human Activity Recognition Using
Smartphones Dataset, as described in the "Original Features" section. These variables and values
will be analyzed according to Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data Peer Assessment, as decribed step
by step in the README.txt file. In brief, after the run_analysis.R program is run, the 2 study
groups (test and trainning) are joined into a single set, and only the variables containing the MEAN
or STANDARD DEVIATION are kept. The final result is achieved by further taking the MEAN of every
variable selected in the last step, according to subject and activity (walking, walking downstairs,
walking upstairs, sitting, standing and laying).

To achieve these results, the dplyr R package was used to join datasets, to create groups of data, 
calculate the mean, and summarize the results. These steps are fully documented inside the 
run_analysis.R script itself in the form of comment lines, so you can follow along the analysis process, if you desire.

Output Features - MEAN and STANDARD DEVIATION variables
=======================================================

After the run_analysis.R program is run, the features in the output file (Peer Assessment.txt) 
are only those containing the MEAN and STANDARD DEVIATION, as described below. XYZ denote three different axis variables (X, Y and Z), so for each of these variables, there will be a total of 3 in the dataset. However, it's important to note that not all of these variables may be present in the output. The units (and meaning) of each variable are described down below, in the "Original Features" section. In brief, variables preceeded by 'f' correspond to FREQUENCY measurements, whereas those preceeded by 't' are TIME measurements:

tBodyAcc-XYZ-mean

tBodyAccJerk-XYZ-mean
tBodyGyro-XYZ-mean

Original Features  
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw
signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured
at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass
Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration
signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-
XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz.

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk
signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional
signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag,
tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag).

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ,
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to
indicate frequency domain signals).

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:   '-XYZ' is
used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean
