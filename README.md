##INTRODUCTION
This file explains how to use the run_analysis.R program. It is a Peer Assessment of the Coursera's

3. The detailed explanation for this data can be found in:
>http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

4. Extract the data in the same directory as the run_analysis.R program

##INSTALLATION

To install, either download the run_analysis.R program from:
>https://github.com/dsaito/cleaningdata-peer-assessment/

The code should work as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory (i.e. extracted from ".zip" to "/UCI HAR DATASET").
